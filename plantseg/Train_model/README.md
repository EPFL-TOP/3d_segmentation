## File Descriptions

### 1. `config.yml`
This configuration file

#### Usage:
1. Make sure to change all the paths : model_path, pretrained/resume,checkpoint_dir, file_path
2. You can change as you want the other options
3. Go to the train.py file

---

### 2. `train.py`
This script is used to train a 3D segmentation model using the PyTorch framework and the PlantSeg configuration.

#### Usage:
1. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.
3. Update the path for the training logs and the config file
2. Run the script
